# Scoreboard (Sidebar) API
This is a fork of the [Scoreboard API](https://github.com/ColoredCarrot/scoreboard-sidebar-api) project. The original SpigotMC page is [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/scoreboard-sidebar-api.21042/).

## Fork Differences
The only purpose for this fork was to remove PlaceholderAPI dependencies. When attempting to use a legacy version of this project with Paper 1.12.2, PlaceholderAPI removed some class the pre-bundled version within this project was dependent upon. This fork removes the dependency entirely.

This was done to enable [Friday the 13th Minecraft](https://f13mc.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/austinpilz/FridayThe13th)) to work on Paper 1.12.2
